![Project Banner](optional-banner-image-url)  
*A decentralized storage solution built on Filecoin with Alkahest, leveraging Kavacha and Storj as storage providers, and using Coophive as a trust framework.*

---

## 📌 Overview
Datasets Hub is a decentralized storage platform that:
- Utilizes **Filecoin's blockchain network** for secure, distributed storage
- Integrates **Alkahest-Filecoin** for enhanced storage protocols
- Partners with **Kavacha** and **Storj** as primary storage providers
- Implements **Coophive framework** to establish verifiable trust mechanisms
- Features **Storage-as-a-Service Obligations** with smart contract-based guarantees

## ✨ Key Features
### Storage-as-a-Service Obligations
- **Smart Contract-Based Commitments**  
  Customizable obligation contracts for storage services with adjustable parameters.
  
- **Oracle-Integrated Verification**  
  Off-chain oracles for real-time storage proof validation and integrity checks.

- **Provider Guarantees**  
  Enables storage providers to offer conditional service-level agreements (SLAs) with cryptographic enforcement.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [ ] Metamasl wallet (ethereum sepolia network)
- [ ] python3+ (if applicable)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/datasets-hub.git

2. Navigate to each folder and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend/flask_app && pip install -r requirementstxt
    cd frontend && npm install or npm install -force

3. Running the Project
    - Start the backend:
    ```bash 
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 run.py

    - Start the backend:
    ```bash 
    npm run start

### Key Notes:
1. **Folder Separation**: Clearly defined the 3 core directories with brief purposes.
2. **Obligations Highlight**: Dedicated section for your Storage-as-a-Service contracts.
3. **Placeholders**: Replace `(Specify...)`, `your-username`, and dependency lists with actual values.
4. **Extensible**: Add badges (e.g., CI/CD), detailed API docs, or architecture diagrams as needed.

Would you like me to add any specific technical details (e.g., contract functions, API endpoints) or modify the structure further?
